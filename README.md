# Github WebServices template
This template allows you to make calls using the Github API to access information in the repositories.

# Prerequisites
* OpCon 18.3+
* WebServices Connector 20.1+ (recommended)

# Instructions
Import the repository to a new Web Services connector job in OpCon.  The template contains a few examples:  

Variables -
 * @org - The organization you want to target (ie "smatechnologies")
 * @repo - A specific repository you wish to download from (ie "search-opcon-properties-sql")

"Step 1" is an example of calling an organization and returning ALL repositories (such as getting all the repositories/examples from our SMA Innovation Lab).

"Step 2/3" are examples of getting information from a specific repository and then downloading a file from one of its releases.
